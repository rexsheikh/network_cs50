    - change the view to accept a parameter (string that is allPosts, profilePage,or following)
    - change the url
        - all posts (every single post)
        - profile page (all the user's posts)
        - following (all the posts from user's that the user is following)
    
2. build out profile pages 
    - anchor tags on user to take a user to either their page or another user's 
    - each page has follow or unfollow 
        - if it the user's profile page, these buttons do not appear
        - conditionally load 'follow' or 'unfollow' buttons 

3. likes and unlikes 
    - any user can like any post 
    - do this asynchronously
